\title{Find number of tickets to sell (discrete and normal approx)}
\usage{
ntickets(N, gamma, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{Integer. Number of seats on the flight.}

\item{gamma}{Numeric in (0,1). Acceptable probability that the plane
is truly overbooked (more people show than seats).}

\item{p}{Numeric in (0,1). Probability that an individual ticket-holder shows up.}
}
\value{
A named list with elements:
\item{nd}{integer: number of tickets from exact discrete/binomial calculation}
\item{nc}{integer: number of tickets from normal approximation (continuity corrected)}
\item{N}{the seats input}
\item{p}{show probability input}
\item{gamma}{target overbooking probability input}
}
\description{
\code{ntickets} computes the number of tickets to sell given
the number of seats \code{N}, show probability \code{p}, and target
overbooking probability \code{gamma}. It returns both a discrete
(binomial) solution and a normal-approximation solution, and plots
objective functions for both.
